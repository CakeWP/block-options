## Estimated Reading Time
Word count is already available on Gutenberg editor. EditorsKit then extend this word count and display estimated count as well. Using roughly 275 word per minute plus additional calculations based on image blocks, you can display better estimated reading time on your posts and pages.

Powered by shortcode you can display the Estimated Reading Time on your content by using the code below.

* `before` : Text or element you want to display before reading time.
* `after` : Text or element you want to display after reading time.
* `tag` : default `div` : Html tag container
* `fallback` : set value to 'true' to display PHP based wordcount on old posts that are not edited or created through Gutenberg

## ShareABlock block
Insert your downloads from [shareablock.com](https://shareablock.com/) easily using this block. Browse through your block patterns and templates then add them to your content in just a click.

## Template and Pattern Library

EditorsKit now includes access to the Extendify template and pattern library that can be accessed by clicking the "Library" button in the menu bar of the editor. We provide a variety of templates and patterns to serve different use cases and are adding more templates every week.

Note: Templates and patterns rely on blocks and styling applied by the Editor Plus plugin. The Editor Plus plugin is required when importing a template or pattern. If you uninstall Editor Plus, the templates and patterns will still display on your site, but the styling may be affected. Additionally, stock images included in the templates are hosted by Extendify. We recommend replacing the images or adding them to your media library directly.

## Privacy

EditorsKit uses a custom API to fetch templates and patterns from the Extendify template and pattern library. To improve the service and stability we store logs which may contain the following:

* browser type
* referring site
* date and time of request
* category selection or search term
* anonymized IP address

API requests are only made when a user clicks on the Library button.
